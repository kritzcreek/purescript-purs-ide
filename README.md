# purescript-purs-ide
Communicating with PureScript's IDE server from PureScript

This is a rewrite of my earlier `purescript-psc-ide` library, but using the libraries and techniques I like these days.
It's also a way for me to stop supporting some of the quirks we accumulated over time without having to change both the VSCode as well as the Atom plugin. 
The first goal is to get this to a point where I can use this in `pscid`
